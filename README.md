HTL Junior Project "smartbox" 
This project was created for students who are interested in Electronics. You will find here a guide on how to set up your ESP8266 mini D1

# extensions for the project: 

The Starterpack only contains the ESP8266, one PCB and 3 LEDS, altho you can easily buy other electronics stuff too and connect them with the ESP8266. We try to keep this guide up-to-date and release new parts too
Let us know what you would want us to add per Discord or per Instagram.
